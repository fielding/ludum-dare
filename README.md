# Fielding’s LudumDare48 Entries

## What is this?
The purpose of this repository is to act as an archive of my ludum dare submissions. Each entry is frozen in time based on the code/project as it was at the end of the competiton. If any of these are continued past their LD48 state then they become a project of their own, and a fresh up to date repo with additions that have been added since the competition. 

I like the idea of showing the code as it was when the competition ended, to keep the spirit of the competition, and as a reminder to myself of both the good and the bad I accomplished in each 48hr window.

## What is Ludum Dare?
