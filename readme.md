## What is this?
This repository is a collection of all my games/entries made during a [Ludum
Dare 48 hour game programming competition](http://www.ludumdare.com/). Each
entry is very strictly frozen in time based on the code/project as it was
at the end of the competiton. I like the idea of showing the code as it was
when the competition ended, to keep the spirit of the competition, and as a
reminder to myself of both the good and the bad parts of what I accomplished
in each 48hr window.

Any development, polish or even debugging for any of these games past the 48hr
competition will take place in a new git repository dedicated to that game, and 
hopefully the full fledged project that it evolves in to. The only forseen
exceptions to this will involve migrating/updating games that are no longer
able to be demo'd due to updates or major releases on their target platform/os.
In these cases the code will be altered until the game mimics the immediate
post-competition state as close as possible.


## What is Ludum Dare?
 [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) as described on their website:

> “Ludum Dare is a regular accelerated game development Event.  Participants
> develop games from scratch in a weekend, based on a theme suggested by
> community.”

Immediately this appeals to me as a developer/designer who has strong feelings,
opinions, and investments in the entire spectrum of game design. From design,
art, and ui/user interaction to logic, physics and exploring new game paradigms.
I love it all, and Ludum Dare delivers a focused dose of all of that and more.

Also, by limiting the time, I can easily allow myself to post unfinished,
nonpolished, and far from perfection work to showcase my skills due to knowing
that generally the 48hr limitation is understood by viewers. As contradictory
as it sounds, by restricting they are actually liberating.

number in my entry list*
